This project is a Text Editor app - similar to Notepad - made with Visual Studio & C# programmming language. The EXE file is available in the "bin" folder. Main features I learned and build while developing this project:

- working with WinForms
- making UI elements (buttons, interactions)
- making basic Text Editor tools: Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Cut, Select All, etc.
- creating a functional save system for TXT files
- working with VS tools and properties features
- build an executable file from a VS solution
